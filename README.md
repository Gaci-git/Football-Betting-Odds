# Football-Betting-Odds

Let's imagine that we are data scientists working in a sports betting company. The business executives in our company after some initial analysis identified a new potential opportunity - betting on football. A European one. 

Let's familiarize ourselves with a football dataset found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prajitdatta/ultimate-25k-matches-football-database-european)  and search for anything that could give us a competitive advantage in the attempt to bet on a successful team and win. We will try to find the best teams in the league, and simulate matches between them!
